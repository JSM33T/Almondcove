## Historical Overview

&emsp;At the turn of the 20th century, a groundbreaking discovery unfolded as Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, discovered a captivating element known as RADIUM. 
Its mesmerizing luminescence captured imaginations of many, but its hidden dangers remained elusive.


&emsp;Marie Curie, unaware of the danger, handled test tubes brimmed with radioactive isotopes, admiring their radiant glow. 
Unfortunately, her fascination had significant consequences. 
Over time, she developed a condition known as "aplastic anemia" due to radiation exposure, ultimately leading to her untimely demise. 
Concurrently, the introduction of X-rays brought optimism to the medical field. 
These rays were praised for their effectiveness in treating certain skin cancers and eliminating deeply rooted tumors. 
Despite the medical community's celebration of this discovery, lingering uncertainties persisted regarding potential side effects. 
The early 20th century witnessed remarkable scientific advancements alongside the sobering realities that often accompanied them, illustrating the intricate balance between progress and unforeseen risks.

## Radium in everyday use

The mesmerizing glow of radium-infused products became a symbol of modernity and progress, particularly in watchmaking, where it illuminated timepieces in the dark, adding a fashionable mystique. However, this seemingly innocuous integration concealed a perilous reality. The Radium Girls, employed in factories to paint watch dials, unknowingly exposed themselves to the silent threat of a potent radioactive substance, turning the very material creating the enticing glow into a hazardous menace.

Radium's infiltration into cosmetics added another layer of concern. Promising a radiant complexion, these products tapped into public fascination with the newfound element. Yet, beneath their visual appeal, lurked serious health risks for regular users. This chapter in history serves as a stark reminder of the unforeseen dangers accompanying technological enthusiasm and underscores the need for rigorous safety measures and ethical considerations in embracing new materials.

## Tragic Consequences

The women known as “Radium Girls” would use fine brushes to apply the glowing paint, often licking the brushes to create a finer point. 
Little did they know that they were ingesting radium with each lick. Radium, a highly radioactive element, accumulates in the bones, emitting alpha particles that damage surrounding tissue. As a result, these young 
women faced gruesome consequences _ deteriorating health, excruciating pain and ultimately, death.



The initial symptoms were subtle: fatigue, aches and anemia. However, as the radium accumulated in their bodies, the Radium Girls began to experience severe bone pain, necrosis, and disfigurement. Their suffering was compounded by the fact that radium poisoning was a relatively unknown condition at the time, making diagnosis and treatment elusive.


## Legal Battles and worker's rights

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the face of insurmountable health challenges, the Radium Girls embarked on legal battles against the companies responsible for their plight. Their perseverance led to landmark cases that not only sought justice for the affected workers but also reshaped the landscape of workers' rights. The courtroom dramas became a turning point, prompting the establishment of improved safety standards and regulations, setting a precedent for future labor laws.
